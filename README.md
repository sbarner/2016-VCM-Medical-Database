<h1>VCM Medical Database Application</h1>
<p>The VCM Medical Database Application is developed for use during the annual Vermont City Marathon to track athletes receiving 
medical services during the event.  This iteration is a web-based application which will run on a local server during the event, 
and be accessed from laptops connected to a secure wireless network, set up the day of the event in the main medical tent.</p>
<p>Others may find this application valuable for similar events.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Tenzin Lhakhang, without whose assistance, success in this project would almost cetainly be impossible.</p>
